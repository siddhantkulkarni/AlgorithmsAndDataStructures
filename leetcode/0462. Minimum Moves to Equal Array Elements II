462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II

Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]

class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int x = 0, y = nums.length - 1, count = 0;
        while(x < y){
            count += (nums[y--] - nums[x++]);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
