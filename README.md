# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures
Over the last 3 to 4 years, I have solved several problems on sites such as Hackerrank and Leetcode.
I found a fairly open afternoon and decided to create this repository of my solutions that were accepted by the test cases set up by respective site.
It was interesting for me to see how my clean coding practices have evolved over the years as well as to see how many different pieces of codes I have written over the years without realizing it.

All the solutions included in this repository were accepted by the sites. Some of the codes might not be the most optimal solutions.
Moreover, some of the codes I wrote in earlier years might be bone hurting for clean code practitioners, but please try to understand that it was part of my evolution as a developer.
